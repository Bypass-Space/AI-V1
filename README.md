# AI-V1

This project contains two ways or "Options" you can access the OpenAI API for ChatGPT and the Codex.

This will be updated as time goes on and more "Options" may be added.

Note - In ANY of the code where it says "INSERT YOUR OPENAI API KEY" insert your own key.

Note - You may need to install some modifications or extensions using the "pip install _" command in your PC/Mac terminal.

Note - You will need to have Python installed.

All credit regarding API proceedures and the API itself belongs to OpenAI.
